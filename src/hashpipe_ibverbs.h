// a `hashpipe_ibverbs` function that initiates such activity.  After this
// function returns successfully, the user can set the queue pair state
// explicitly, if desired, by calling ibv_modify_qp() directly.  The associated
// `send_wr` structs will have the IBV_SEND_IP_CSUM flag set if the underlying

// This function returns 0 on success, non-zero on error.

// The caller must provide the following things in the `hashpipe_ibv_context`
// sturcture pointed to by `hibv_ctx`:
//
// 1. The desired interface name.
// 2. Packet buffer sizing info.
// 3. Number of "flow" rules to support.
// 4. User managed flag
// 5. User managed buffers (if user managed flag is set to true)
//
// * INTERFACE NAME
//   (`interface_name`)
//
//   The desired interface name MUST be copied into the `interface_name` buffer
//   in the `hashpipe_ibv_context` structure pointed to by `hibv_ctx`.  Be
//   aware that this buffer has space for at most `IFNAMSIZ` characters,
//   including the trailing NUL.  The recommended way to do this is:
//
//       struct hashpipe_ibv_context hibv_ctx = {0};
//       strncpy(hibv_ctx.interface_name, desired_interface_name, IFNAMSIZ);
//       hibv_ctx.interface_name[IFNAMSIZ-1] = '\0'; // Ensure NUL termination
//
// * PACKET BUFFER SIZING INFO
//   (`send_pkt_num`, `recv_pkt_num`, `pkt_size_max`)
//
//   The library uses two different packet buffers: one for sending and one for
//   receiving.  The send buffer holds up to `send_pkt_num` packets of up to
//   `pkt_size_max` bytes each.  The receive buffer holds up to `recv_pkt_num`
//   packets of up to `pkt_size_max` each.  These values must be always be
//   provided by the user even if the packet buffers and related structures
//   will be user managed.
//
// * NUMBER OF "FLOW" RULES
//   (`max_flows`)
//
//   So called "flow" rules are used to select which incoming packets will be
//   processed by this library.  The number of flow rules to support is
//   specified here by the user (though it obviously must be within the bounds
//   supported by the NIC).  A value of 0 will be treated (and changed to) a
//   value of 1.
//
// * USER MANAGED FLAG
//   (`user_managed_flag`)
//
//   This is an indication of whether packet buffers and related structures are
//   user managed (as opposed to library managed).  The `user_managed_flag`
//   should be set to 0 to allow the library to manage the packet buffers.  It
//   is envisioned that this will suffice for the vast majority of users.
//
//   When `user_managed_flag` is false (0), the library will allocate the
//   packet send and receive buffers, create work requests with a single
//   element scatter/gather list, and register the memory regions allocated for
//   the packet buffers.
//
//   When `user_managed_flag` is true (non-zero), the user must allocate the
//   packet send and receive buffers and allocate and initialize the work
//   requests with scatter/gather lists as desired.  See USER MANGED BUFFERS
//   below for more details.
//
// * USER MANAGED BUFFERS
//   (`send_pkt_buf`, `recv_pkt_buf`, `send_sge_buf`, `recv_sge_buf`,
//   `send_mr_buf`, `recv_mr_buf`)
//
//   When `user_managed_flag` is true (non-zero), the user must perform the
//   following additional steps prior to calling `hashpipe_ibv_init()`:
//
//   1. Allocate the packet send and receive buffers (memory regions) and store
//      the corresponding pointers in the `send_mr_buf` and `recv_mr_buf`
//      fields `hibv_ctx`.
//
//   2. Allocate the send and receive `struct hashpipe_ibv_{send,recv}_pkt`
//      (packet/work request) arrays and store the corresponding pointers in
//      the `send_pkt_buf` and `recv_pkt_buf` fields of `hibv_ctx`.  Note that
//      the send work requests in `send_pkt_buf` will be (re-)linked into a
//      single linked list when calling this function.  The `send_pkt_head`
//      field will be initialized to the same value as `send_pkt_buf`.  The
//      receive work requests in `recv_pkt_buf` will be explicitly un-linked
//      when calling this function.  The `wr_id` fields of each send and
//      receive work request will be set to the structure's index within the
//      array of `hashpipe_ibv_*_pkt` structures.  This is necessary because
//      the `wr_id` value from a work completion is used to access the
//      `hashpipe_ibv_*pkt` structure containing the corresponding work
//      request.
//
//   3. Allocate the send and receive `struct ibv_sge` (scatter/gather
//      elements) arrays and the corresponding pointers in the `send_sge_buf`
//      and `recv_sge_buf` fields of `hibv_ctx`.
//
//   4. Initialize the work requests and scatter/gather elements as desired.
//
//   If the user would like the library to free the user allocated memory for
//   all of these buffers or structures, then the `user_managed_flag` can be
//   set to false (0) before calling `hashpipe_ibv_shutdown()`.  Otherwise the
//   user will remain responsible for freeing these memory allocations after
//   `hashpipe_ibv_shutdown()` returns.
int hashpipe_ibv_init(struct hashpipe_ibv_context * hibv_ctx);

// This function releases all library managed resources and frees all library
// managed memory associated with `hibv_ctx`.  If `user_managed_flag` is false
// (0), this will include freeing buffers associated with send and receive work
// requests, scatter/gather lists, and packet buffers.  The user can set
// `user_managed_flag` to 0 before calling this function to pass ownership of
// user managed buffers to the library, if desired.  This function returns the
// number of errors returned by the cleanup functions it calls.  A return value
// of 0 indicates success.
int hashpipe_ibv_shutdown(struct hashpipe_ibv_context * hibv_ctx);

// `hashpipe_ibv_flow() is used to setup flow rules on the NIC to
// select which incoming packets will be passed to us by the NIC.  Flows are
// specified by providing values that various fields in the packet headers must
// match.  Fields that can be matched exist at the Ethernet level, the IPv4
// level, and the TCP/UDP level.  The fields available for matching are:
//
//   - dst_mac    Ethernet destination MAC address (uint8_t *)
//   - src_mac    Ethernet source MAC address      (uint8_t *)
//   - ether_type Ethernet type field              (uint16_t)
//   - vlan_tag   Ethernet VLAN tag                (uint16_t)
//   - src_ip     IP source address                (uint32_t)
//   - dst_ip     IP destination address           (uint32_t)
//   - src_port   TCP/UDP source port              (uint16_t)
//   - dst_port   TCP/UDP destination port         (uint16_t)
//
// The `flow_idx` parameter specifies which flow rule to assign this flow to.
// The user specifies `max_flows` when initializing the `hashpipe_ibv_context`
// structure and `flow_idx` must be less than that number.  If a flow already
// exists at the index `flow_idx`, that flow is destroyed before the new flow
// is created and stored at the same index.
//
// The `flow_type` field specifies the type pf the flow.  Supported values are:
//
// IBV_FLOW_SPEC_ETH   This matches packets only at the Ethernet layer.  Match
//                     fields for IP/TCP/UDP are ignored.
//
// IBV_FLOW_SPEC_IPV4  This matches at the Ethernet and IPv4 layers.  Match
//                     fields for TCP/UDP are ignored.  Flow rules at this
//                     level include an implicit match on the Ethertype field
//                     (08 00) to select only IP packets.
//
// IBV_FLOW_SPEC_TCP   These match at the Ethernet, IPv4, and TCP/UDP layers.
// IBV_FLOW_SPEC_UDP   Flow rules of these types include an implicit match on
//                     the Ethertype field to select only IP packets and the IP
//                     protocol field to select only TCP or UDP packets.
//
// Not all fields need to be matched.  For fields for which a match is not
// desired, simply pass NULL or 0 for the corresponding parameter to
// `hashpipe_ibv_flow` and that field will be excluded from the matching
// process.  This means that it is not possible to match against zero valued
// fields except for the bizarre case of a zero valued MAC address.  In
// practice this is unlikely to be a problem.
//
// Passing NULL/0 for all the match fields will result in the destruction of
// any flow at the `flow_idx` location, but no new flow will be stored there.
//
// The `src_mac` and `dst_mac` pointers, if non-NULL, must point to a 6 byte
// buffer containing the desired MAC address in network byte order.  Note that
// the `mac` field of `hibv_ctx` will contain the MAC address of the NIC port
// being used.  Some NICs may require a `dst_mac` match in order to enable any
// packet reception at all.  This can be the unicast MAC address of the NIC
// port or a multicast Ethernet MAC address for receiving multicast packets.
// If a multicast `dst_ip` is given, `dst_mac` will be ignored and the
// multicast MAC address corresponding to `dst_ip` will be used.  If desired,
// multicast MAC addresses can be generated from multicast IP addresses using
// the ETHER_MAP_IP_MULTICAST macro defined in <netinet/if_ether.h>.
//
// The non-MAC  parameters are passed as values and must be in host byte order.
